            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing 
                Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a 
                member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL
                ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members
